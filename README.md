## Limitations

While "NewWriters-Android" strives to provide a compelling reading experience, there are a few limitations to be aware of:

- Device compatibility may affect the availability of certain features or the overall experience.

- As with any content platform, the quality and diversity of available content can impact user satisfaction.

- Depending on the backend infrastructure and server performance, the responsiveness of fetching content may vary.

These limitations serve as considerations for future development and refinement as we aim to create a reading experience that caters to a wide range of users.
